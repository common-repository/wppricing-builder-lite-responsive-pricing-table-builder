== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install and use the plugin? =
It's very easy, just watch this video:
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAIO84Ew-X8]

= How many columns (pricing plans) can I add in a pricing table? =
Every design supports 2, 3, 4 columns, only the [Full Version](https://swebdeveloper.com/apps/wordpress-builder-responsive-pricing-tables/) supports 5.

= How many color themes are supported by each design? =
It's 5 initially. Only in the [Full Version](https://swebdeveloper.com/apps/wordpress-builder-responsive-pricing-tables/) you can load a whole collection of color themes. Depending on design, a collection can contain from 10 to 30 color themes.

= Can I pick my own color for a pricing table? =
Yes, but only in the [Full Version](https://swebdeveloper.com/apps/wordpress-builder-responsive-pricing-tables/). You can generate infinite number of color themes for every design by picking your color. It works the same way like in [this livepreview (click on a green button, called - "Generate custom color")](https://swebdeveloper.com/apps/wordpress-builder-responsive-pricing-tables/comparative-responsive-pricing-tables-flat/).

= Does the plugin slow down a website performance? =
No. It has its own simple cache to store a generated pricing table. Only minimal number of operations are performed every time you visit a page with a pricing table.

= Does the plugin influence loading speed of pages? =
No. It loads minimal number of styles which are required for a pricing table and only on pages where it's used.

= Can I set a color theme for each column separately? =
Yes, but this feature is only available in [Full Version](https://swebdeveloper.com/apps/wordpress-builder-responsive-pricing-tables/).
